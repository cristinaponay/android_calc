# My First Android Calculator

This is a basic Android calculator that is designed just like the Windows 10 Standard calculator which does not follow the standard order of operations. This is a school assignment for our Android course and the instructor specifically said that we will just build a rolling calculator. I may change it in the future but for now this is it.

This is how the application looks like on portrait mode:

This is how it will look like in landscape mode:
